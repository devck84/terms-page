            <li>Contains software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.</li>

            <li>Impersonates any person or entity, or falsely states or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor and remove any User Content that we, in our sole discretion, find to be in violation of these Terms or otherwise objectionable.</p>

        <h2>4. License to Your Content</h2>
        <p>By posting User Content on spawnr, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such User Content throughout the world in any media.

        <h2>6. GDPR and Data Privacy</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your data and privacy in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms, explains how we collect, use, and share your personal data.</p>
        <h3>6.1. Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, create or share content, and communicate with us. This may include your username, email address, bio, links, and favorite games. We also collect information automatically when you use the Service, such as your IP address, device type, and operating system.</p>
        <h3>6.2. Use of Your Data</h3>

        <h3>6.3. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Under the GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your data. You can exercise these rights through your profile settings or by contacting us directly.</p>

        <h2>7. Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
        <p>We use Google's AdMob service to display advertisements in the app. AdMob may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about you and your device to serve personalized, T-rated ads. By using spawnr, you consent to the collection and use of this information for advertising purposes. You can manage your ad personalization settings in your device's settings.</p>

        <h2>8. Future Subscriptions and Payments (Stripe)</h2>
        <p>We plan to offer premium features through subscription plans ("Pro Plans") in the future. These plans will remove ads and provide additional functionalities. Payments for Pro Plans will be processed by Stripe. We do not store your full credit card information.</p>
        <p>The specific terms of the Pro Plans, including pricing (monthly or yearly) and features, will be made available at the time of their launch. By purchasing a Pro Plan, you agree to the payment terms presented at that time.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so through the app's settings.</p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. To the fullest extent permitted by law, spawnr shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
